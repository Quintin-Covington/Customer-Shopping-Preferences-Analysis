# Customer Shopping Preferences Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer demographics and shopping behaviors across 3,900 customers from various U.S. states. Using R for data cleaning, munging, and visualization, we extract actionable insights to inform inventory management, targeted marketing strategies, and business growth planning.

The primary goal is to understand:
- Who the target demographic is (age, gender, location)
- What products generate the most revenue
- How seasonal patterns affect purchasing
- What payment methods customers prefer
- How often customers make purchases

## Skills Used
- R Programming (Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization)
- Tidyverse and ggplot2 libraries
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Business Insights from Data
- Data Munging Techniques

## Dataset Attributes
- 3,900 customers
- 18 attributes per transaction, including:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Item Purchased
  - Category
  - Purchase Amount (USD)
  - Purchase Location (State)
  - Payment Method
  - Shipping Type
  - Discount/Pricing Information
  - Review Ratings
  - Subscription Status

## Analytical Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing NAs, cleaning column names, transforming fields.
- **Customer Demographic Analysis:** Distribution by gender and age.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Product preferences, payment methods, seasonality trends, purchase frequency.
- **Focused Demographic Analysis:** Special focus on 35â€“54-year-old customers, who accounted for ~60% of total purchases.

## Key Findings
- **Demographics:** Middle-aged males (35â€“54 years old) are the largest and most profitable demographic segment.
- **Top Product Categories:** Clothing and Accessories are the best sellers.
- **State Insights:** California and Illinois generate the highest total revenue.
- **Preferred Payment Method:** Credit cards are the most used payment method, followed by third-party apps (e.g., Venmo, PayPal).
- **Purchase Frequency:** Most common purchase frequency is monthly and every three months.

## Visuals
- Gender and age distribution pie charts
- State-by-state heatmaps for purchases and revenue
- Purchase frequency histograms
- Seasonality purchase trends
- Product category bar charts

## How to Run
1. Open the provided `.R` scripts using RStudio.
2. Install missing R packages (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `RColorBrewer`, etc.).
3. Load the cleaned dataset and run analysis scripts to reproduce all insights and visualizations.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing on middle-aged male demographic (35â€“54 years old).
- Expand clothing and accessories inventory.
- Explore regional marketing strategies for states like Kansas.
- Form partnerships with credit card companies to enhance payment experience and promotions.
